## Course Description

You’ve got a head full of ideas when it comes to creating a web app, but where do you start? In this 3 session workshop, you’ll learn Ruby, Rails, GIT, Open Source and Cloud Computing basics that will get you moving the right direction in your app development process. In this workshop, we'll take you through building a complete web application using Ruby on Rails. By the end of the day, you'll have an application on the internet that connects to a database and reads and writes information.

Each participant needs to bring their own laptop with Ruby on Rails Virtual Machince Installed.

### Instructor

Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development.  As a professional programmer you will never write anything from scratch.  This class is structured such that all solutions are public.  You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers.  I won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they  are simply wasting their time and money taking this class.

Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find, and if you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment.
